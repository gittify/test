| **Phase** | **Activity** | **Description** | **Entry** | **Exit** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Inception | Plan and prepare business case | Define risk mitigation strategy, develop an initial project plan and identify known cost, schedule, and profitability trade-offs | An original vision or request for proposal or a mock-up expressing the need for the system | An initial business case containing at least a clear formulation of the product vision.An initial risk assessment and revenue projection. |
|   | Formulate scope | Needs of every stakeholder, scope, boundary      conditions and acceptance criteria established | List of features or some assets like software, know-how etc to determine scope | The core requirements - in terms of functionality, scope, performance, capacity, technology base are established by an initial use-case model and  a vision document |
| Elaboration | Detail a use case | Review and refine the scenarios. Detail and structure the flow of events | Scope and scenarios from the previous phase | Use case design document use case model and detailing each use case scenarios with normal and alternate flowsSupplementary non functional requirements are identified |
|   | Design components | Identify classes and interfaces and model interaction between components | Requirement specification from the previous phase | Project plan is defined. Detailed design document is completed.A test plan detailing the types of testing performed, test cases and test scenarios is produced and an executable prototype is developed |
|   | Define architecture | Define the high-level organization .key abstractions and development environment | Plan approved and artifacts from previous phase | A domain analysis model, and the corresponding architecture &#39;complete&#39;.An executable architecture baseline and development environment |
|   | Refine plan and estimates | Refine project plan and estimates.Update risk assessment document | Use the information gathered from the previous phase  | Revised project plan and risk assessmentPreliminary user manual is created |
| Construction | Develop and test components | Components required satisfying the use cases, scenarios, and other functionality are built. Unit and integration tests (Quality assurance) are performed on Components.  | Defects fixed and risks mitigated during the iteration | All use cases realized with traceability information.Test cases and results of the tests conducted on the product. |
|   | Perform beta release | Software product integrated on adequate platforms.Finalize user manual | Artifacts of previous phase | A release description document, which captures the complete system test results.Complete set of artifacts including documents and code.  |
| Transition | Plan Deployment to user environment | Test the product deliverable in a customer environment. Fine tune the product based upon customer feedback,Deliver the final product to the end user | A software product sufficiently mature to be put into the hands of its users | Deployment plan describing how to package, distribute and install the software.Release notes describing features in the product.   |
|   | Handle issues | Perform various maintenance like corrective maintenance for bug reports, perfective maintenance for feature requests and adaptive maintenance for environment  | Bug reports , system failure reports or improvement requests | New release of the software with maintenance performed.Product in use |
|   | Develop end-user support material | Train customer service and provide help-line assistance | Product deployed and fully functional is customer environment | An update of some of the previous documents, as necessary, the plan being replaced by a &quot;post-mortem&quot; analysis of the performance of the project relative to its original and revised success criteria |
